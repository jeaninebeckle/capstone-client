# It Takes A Village

## Description
This is my backend capstone for Nashville Software School's Evening 12 Cohort! I built this to be a resource toolkit for volunteers and staff that are involved with a local Nashville organization's after-school tutoring program. Since I volunteer with this program as well, I wanted to give back to them in a way that utilized the new skills I've acquired through NSS. It allows volunteers to have quick access to announcements, the weekly tutoring sign-up slots, accordions containing frequently-accessed tutoring resource links, and donation requests posted on a "needs board". Staff have additional permissions to view all registered users and control the site's content, such as posting and deleting new announcements or donation needs. 

### Feature List
* Full stack app built with React JS and Django on the backend
* Styling with SASS and React Bootstrap
* Login/registration and different permissions for volunteers, staff, and unauthenticated users
* Tutoring signup connects to user's Google calendar
* Full CRUD throughout the app
* Hosted on Google Firebase
